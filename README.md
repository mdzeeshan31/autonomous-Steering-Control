# autonomous-Steering-Control
M.Tech Thesis
Developed an auxiliary steering system for autonomous vehicles, ensuring precise steering control.
Created CAD models and conducted simulations using Solid Edge software to optimize the design.
Recorded data from an internal test bed and trained a lane detection algorithm using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the steering angle.
Implemented the algorithm by sending the predicted steering angle to a microcontroller via serial communication with an Arduino.
Utilized this signal to actuate the steering system, which, in turn, controlled the steering motor using a gear system.
Incorporated a potentiometer to calculate the error between the predicted and actual steering rotation.
Emphasized that the thesis was conducted to demonstrate the proof of concept for the auxiliary steering system.
This is an end-to-end project from designing the mechanical system, recording video, and calculating the steering angle on the test bed using a computer vision algorithm.After that tested the whole concept on Maruti Suzuki 800 car.
